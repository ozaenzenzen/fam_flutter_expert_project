          "overview": "Phoenix is an Australian police drama television series. Phoenix screened as two thirteen-part series on Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1992 and 1993.\n\nThe first series of Phoenix in 1992 recounted the investigation of the bombing of the Victorian state police headquarters, loosely based on a real case in the mid-1980s, the Russell Street Bombing. It was aided by extensive research into police techniques and was lauded as one of the most realistic depictions of police investigation techniques, including both surveillance and forensics, as well as having an involving storyline.\n\nThe series was notable for its dark visual tone and for its no-holds-barred attitude to violence and language.\n\nIt spawned a second thirteen-part series, Phoenix II, in 1993 as well as a spin-off series, Janus, in 1994 devoted to the machinations of court cases.\n\nThe series was created and produced by Tony McDonald and Alison Nisselle and screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe ABC have released Series 1 and 2 on DVD as a 4 DVD box set.",
